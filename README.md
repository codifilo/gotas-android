# Gotas Android
Gotas is an Android application that predicts rainfall for short term time periods.
I developed this app to put into practice what I recently learnt about Kotlin, Haskell and Docker.

In this repo you can only find the client side Android application written in Kotlin that retrieves the user GPS location or the location selected by the user and then connects to Haskell backend that sends the amount of rainfall expected in JSON format.
